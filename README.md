I have worked with the CoMentG text mining resource (https://csbg.cnb.csic.es/coment2/9ontologies/index.php) created by CNB-CSIC to find significant co-mentions between diseases, biological functions, clinical signs, cell types, tissues, bacteria and chemical compounds in the scientific literature.

I implemented for the relations between the HPO terms and the MESH terms (almost 9 thousand) the display of the years in which the scientific papers were published. I also studied for each term, thanks to a linear regression with the years of publication, whether the relevance in the relation between the terms has increased in the years or not.

NOTE: The HPO, SYMPT and MESH terms I have uploaded to Github are approximately 50, enough to get an idea of the code. This limitation is due to CNB's Copyright of the complete dataset of terms.
