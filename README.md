I have worked with the CoMentG text mining resource (https://csbg.cnb.csic.es/coment2/9ontologies/index.php) created, among many, by Florecio Pazos' team at CNB-CSIC to find significant co-mentions between biological entities in the scientific literature.

Recently, this approach has been applied to detect relationships between species and symptoms (HPO terms) in the context of allergy (unpublished results). I worked in a system for extracting the temporal profile of the scientific articles co-mentioning a given HPO-species pair. I also studied for each pair, thanks to a linear regression with the years of publication, whether the relevance in the relation between the terms has increased in the years or not.

NOTE: As these relationships have not been published yet, the number of relationships I have uploaded to Github are approximately 50, enough to get an idea of the code. This limitation is due to CNB's Copyright of the complete dataset of terms.
