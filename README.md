I have worked with the CoMentG text mining resource (https://csbg.cnb.csic.es/coment2/9ontologies/index.php) created by CNB-CSIC to find significant co-mentions between diseases, biological functions, clinical signs, cell types, tissues, bacteria and chemical compounds in the scientific literature.
I implemented for the relations between the HPO terms and the MESH terms (almost 9 thousand) the display of the years in which the papers were published, along with a linear regression made with these years in order to assess whether the importance of the relation between the terms has increased in the years or not.
